# Big-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-of-Energy-Consumption-Using-PySpark-Hadoop-and-R

This project focuses on leveraging big data technologies to analyze and visualize energy 
consumption patterns across different regions. Using PySpark for scalable data processing, 
Hadoop for distributed storage, and R for advanced data visualization, this project aims to 
demonstrate how big data tools can be used to extract meaningful insights from large datasets. 
The dataset includes energy usage metrics such as electricity consumption, gas consumption, 
and renewable energy contributions. The project involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, 
performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and anomalies, and building 
machine learning models to predict future energy consumption. By integrating these 
technologies, this project provides a practical demonstration of how big data and machine 
learning can drive data-driven decision-making for energy management
